# patterns

*patterns* try to be a big collection of [design patterns][design_patterns] examples developed with different programming languages, at the moment I have only patterns programmed with Python.

At the moment we have the next design patterns:

Python:

 * [Singleton][python_singleton]
 * [Observer][python_observer]
 * [Prototype][python_prototype]

You can visit the [github](http://github.com/jfcalvo/patterns) page of the project.
